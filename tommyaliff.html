                <p>In the Spring of 2022, I decided to make obtaining a degree and securing a career in the field of Software Engineering my top priority. I began attending Virginia Western Community College, from which I recently graduated with an A.S. in Computer Science.</p>

                <p>The 2024-25 academic year will be my senior year at Radford University. I completed my first graduate level course last semester in cloud database architecture, where I built the backend for a Python-based online discussion forum app using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB. This fall I'll be taking a graduate course in Data Engineering.</p>

                <p>I am officially enrolled in Radford's Secure Software Development program, a fully online bachelor's degree program, but my curriculum is geared towards preparing me to enter Radford's Data and Information Management M.S. program. I am now enrolled in the accelerated master's program, where I earn graduate credits while I am technically still an undergrad.</p>

                <p>All of my classes have been remote. I work remotely as a tutor for the C.S. Department at Virginia Western Community College. I'm self-motivated and excel in a remote working environment. I will eventually be seeking employment as a data engineer. For now I'm interested in internship opportunities and eager for opportunities to engage with other growth-minded individuals.</p>
